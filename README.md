# flue
A piece of code in go

This is my first project in Go.

What **flue** should be someday:
- a duct for binaries and configuration for deploying an infrastructure and/or a distributed application.
- a ditributed configuration and management software.

*flue* aim to replicate and spread itself like a *flu*.

# Why go ?

- a compiled go project is a single binary, which make is good for an heteregenous infrastructure. You just copy the *flue* and it does not need anything else to run (no python dependency, no perl, no ruby, no whatever lib...)
- **Concurency** of course !
- It looks fast
- Not too difficult to learn (I will tell you that in a few weeks)
- A lot of library exists in the standard implementation
